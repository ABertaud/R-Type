Introduction
------------

The mid ‘80s was a renaissance for shooters. In 1985, Konami released Gradius.
Not long later, in 1987, Irem released R-Type. These are two of the most
important games in the genre. It’s completely stunning that, in its relative
infancy, Irem could shape a game as ingenious as R-Type. One of the premiere
side-scrolling shooters, R-Type moved a bit slower than your typical twitch
games, with a meticulous pace and almost leisurely scrolling. The idea wasn’t
to simply blast everything on the screen, although you could certainly try.
The idea was, quite simply, to stay alive. Naturally, given the claustrophobic
nature of the levels, swarming with enemies from every angle, this was never
an easy task.
In this project, we had to make our own version of R-Type.
